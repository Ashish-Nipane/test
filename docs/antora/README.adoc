= Antora Documentation site

:icons: font

This project uses Antora for its documentation site.

== Creating the documentation site

To build the Antora site locally, https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node 16.x] needs to be installed.

[NOTE]
====
This doesn't create the PDFs and Antora assembler files as this is a lot faster.
Refer to the next section on how to create the PDFs.
====

Install all npm dependencies to build the site locally:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

Use the author playbook to generate a local HTML site for a preview:

[source,bash]
----
npm run author
----

Start a minimal webserver to preview the site locally.
Once it has been started, go to http://localhost:5000/keycloak-benchmark/ to preview the contents.

[source,bash]
----
npm run serve
----
