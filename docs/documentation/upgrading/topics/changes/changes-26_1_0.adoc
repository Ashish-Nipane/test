= Infinispan default XML configuration location

Previous releases ignored any change  to `conf/cache-ispn.xml` if the `--cache-config-file` option was not provided.

Starting from this release, when `--cache-config-file` is not set, the default Infinispan XML configuration file is `conf/cache-ispn.xml` as this is both the expected behavior and the implied behavior given the docs of the current and previous releases.
