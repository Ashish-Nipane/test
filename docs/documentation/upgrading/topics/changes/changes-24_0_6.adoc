= Configuring the LDAP Connection Pool

In this release, the LDAP connection pool configuration relies solely on system properties. The main
reason is that the LDAP connection pool configuration is a JVM-level configuration rather than specific to an individual
realm or LDAP provider instance.

Compared to previous releases, any realm configuration related to the LDAP connection pool will be ignored.
If you are migrating from previous versions where any of the following settings are set to your LDAP provider(s), consider using system properties instead:

* `connectionPoolingAuthentication`
* `connectionPoolingInitSize`
* `connectionPoolingMaxSize`
* `connectionPoolingPrefSize`
* `connectionPoolingTimeout`
* `connectionPoolingProtocol`
* `connectionPoolingDebug`
