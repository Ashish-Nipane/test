= Legacy Promise API removed from Keycloak JS adapter

With this release, we have removed the legacy Promise API methods from the Keycloak JS adapter. This means that calling `.success()` and `.error()` on promises returned from the adapter is no longer possible.

= Keycloak JS adapter must be instantiated with the `new` operator

In a previous release we started to actively log deprecation warnings when the Keycloak JS adapter is constructed without the `new` operator. Starting this release doing so will throw an exception instead. This is to align with the expected behavior of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes[JavaScript classes], which will allow further refactoring of the adapter in the future.

= Export and Import perform an automatic build

In previous releases, the `export` and `import` commands required a `build` command to be run first.
Starting with this release, the `export` and `import` commands perform an automatic rebuild of Keycloak if a build time configuration has changed.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Renamed Keycloak Admin client artifacts

After the upgrade to Jakarta EE, artifacts for Keycloak Admin clients were renamed to more descriptive names with consideration for long-term maintainability.
We still provide two separate Keycloak Admin clients, one with Jakarta EE and the other with Java EE support.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Changes to custom Admin Console messages

The Admin Console (and soon also the new Account Console) works slightly different than the rest of Keycloak in regards to how keys for internationalized messages are parsed. This is due to the fact that it uses the https://www.i18next.com/[i18next] library for internationalization. Therefore when defining custom messages for the Admin Console under "Realm Settings" âž¡ "Localization" best practices for i18next must be taken into account. Specifically, when defining a message for the Admin Console it is it important to specify a https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces[namespace] in the key of your message.

For example, let's assume we want to overwrite the https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/025778fe9c745316f80b53fe3052aeb314e868ef/js/apps/admin-ui/public/locales/en/dashboard.json#L3[`welcome`] message shown to the user when a new realm has been created. This message is located in the `dashboard` namespace, same as the name of the original file that holds the messages (`dashboard.json`). If we wanted to overwrite this message we'll have to use the namespace as a prefix followed by the key of the message separated by a colon, in this case it would become `dashboard:welcome`.

= Passthrough proxy mode changes

Installations which use Keycloak's `--proxy` configuration setting with mode *passthrough* should review the documentation as the behavior of this mode has changed.

See the migration guide for more details.
