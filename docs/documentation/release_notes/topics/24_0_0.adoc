= Keycloak JS using `exports` field

The Keycloak JS adapter now uses the https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/[`exports` field] in `package.json`. This improves support for more modern bundlers like Webpack 5 and Vite, but comes with some unavoidable breaking changes. Consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.

= Truststore Improvements

Keycloak introduces an improved truststores configuration options. The Keycloak truststore is now used across the server: for outgoing connections, mTLS, database drivers and more. It's no longer needed to configure separate truststores for individual areas. To configure the truststore, you can put your truststores files or certificates in the default `conf/truststores`, or use the new `truststore-paths` config option. For details refer to the relevant https://www.keycloak.org/server/keycloak-truststore[guide].
