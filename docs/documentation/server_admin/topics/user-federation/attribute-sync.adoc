=== Attribute Sync

Administrators can sync attributes with an external identity store using the built-in `attributes` provider.
When configured with either a full sync period or a changed sync period, Keycloak will automatically run the configured
attribute store provider for all users in the specified groups and add the attributes to the users based on the configured
mappers.

.Configuration

. Select an attribute store provider from the dropdown
