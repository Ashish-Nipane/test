=== {project_name} specific errors

{project_name} server can send error to the client application in OIDC authentication response with parameters `error=temporarily_unavailable` and `error_description=authentication_expired`.
{project_name} sends this error when user is authenticated and has SSO session, but authentication session expired in current browser tab and hence {project_name} server cannot automatically do SSO
re-authentication of the user and redirect back to client with successful response. When client application receives such error, it is ideal to retry authentication immediately and send new
OIDC authentication request to {project_name} server, which should typically always automatically authenticate user due the SSO session and redirect back. More details in
the link:{adminguide_link}#_authentication-sessions[{adminguide_name}].
