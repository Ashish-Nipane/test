<chapter id="server_cache">
    <title>Server Cache</title>
    <para>
        By default, Keycloak caches realm metadata and users.  There are two separate caches, one for realm metadata
        (realm, application, client, roles, etc...) and one for users.  These caches greatly improves the performance of the server.

        <title>Disabling Caches</title>
        <para>
            The realm and user caches can be cleared through the management console.  To
            disable the realm or user cache, you must edit the <literal>keycloak-server.json</literal> file
            in your distribution.  Here's what the config looks like initially.

        <para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
    "userCache": {
        "infinispan" : {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },

    "realmCache": {
        "infinispan" : {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },
]]></programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>You must then change it to:
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
    "userCache": {
        "infinispan" : {
            "enabled": false
        }
    },

    "realmCache": {
        "infinispan" : {
            "enabled": false
        }
    },
]]></programlisting>
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Clear Caches</title>
        <para>
            To clear the realm or user cache, go to the Keycloak admin console Realm Settings->Cache Config page.  Disable the cache
            you want. This will cause the cache to be cleared.
