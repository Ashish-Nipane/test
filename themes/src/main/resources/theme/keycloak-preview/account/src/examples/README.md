This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the keycloak-preview package in the parent directory for development purposes.

Start the keycloak server on port 8180 create a new client called `new` and set `Root URL` to `http://localhost:3000/` or import `new.json`.
After you build the module in the parent folder with `npm run build-module`, then run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to test this.
